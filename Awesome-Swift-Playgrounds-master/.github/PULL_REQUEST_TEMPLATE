Hi!
Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before completing this PR and verify that you have included the following:
[ ] A working link to the playground you want to add, in the correct category and with a proper description.
[ ] If the playground is meant to be run with Xcode, please create a new directory under playgrounds/ 
    with the username of the author and add the playground as a submodule. 
    For example, if you want to add https://github.com/uraimo/Swift-Playgrounds:
    mkdir playgrounds/uraimo
    cd playgrounds/uraimo
    git submodule add https://github.com/uraimo/Swift-Playgrounds
[ ] Increment the playgrounds counter at the top of README.md, for example: 
    ![133 playgrounds](https://img.shields.io/badge/Playgrounds:-133-orange.svg)
    should become: ![134 playgrounds](https://img.shields.io/badge/Playgrounds:-134-orange.svg)
